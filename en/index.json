[{"content":"Obarun and S6 The suite S6 - Skarnet.org\u0026rsquo;s Small \u0026amp; Secure Supervision Software Suite includes an init, one of several projects that rebelled against SystemD by trying to prove there were better and/or simpler ways to do the same thing. For whom?\r\nDespite the official implementation of S6 began to be on Alpine Linux, for some reason the author now collaborates with Adélie Linux, which I\u0026rsquo;ve already tried.\nHowever, the most mature implementation of S6-init seems to be on Obarun, an Arch-based distro and, as far as I know, without any input from the author of S6, despite all of them being French. I say this because S6 still hasn\u0026rsquo;t specified a mechanism to organize the dependencies between services (and being a \u0026ldquo;UNIX Way\u0026rdquo;-zealot, it might never do so), which means someone else has to do it; and Obarun\u0026rsquo;s contribution is a set of scripts called 66\nTherefore, to try S6 I had to install Obarun; being Arch-based, I feared the worst, but compared to Adélie it was actually pretty simple to install.\n\r\rInstallation Notes  The PT-UTF8 locale has bad character rendering on the text console (wrong settings on grub.cfg?)\n\r\rI reinstalled with the en_GB-UTF8 locale and it worked properly. If you install on Minimal mode, VirtualBox\u0026rsquo;s NAT provides the DHCP options and the nameserver address (DHCP option 5) is written to /etc/resolv.conf; on a NATnetwork it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, /etc/resolv.conf has to be edited by hand. VirtualBox bug? NATnetwork is known for being buggy, maybe one of those is failing to send DHCP options - but I didn\u0026rsquo;t deploy a packet sniffer to check\u0026hellip;  S6/66 (v.6.3+) 66 is, as i said, a management layer over the S6 suite, which is based on the creation of a set of trees by the administrator; these trees are something in-between the numerical/alphabetical ordering of SysV-init and the dynamically-updated graph of SystemD.\nExample: installing SSHD The sshd service is installed with\n1  pacman -S --needed openssh   66 stage 1: service script The service script to control the openssh service isn\u0026rsquo;t installed automatically; it must be created, or obtained from the scripts that exist in the observice repository. All the service scripts that exist in this repo can be listed with:\n1  pacman -Sl observice   To install the necessary service script,\n1  pacman -S sshd-66serv   To tell the system the service was added,\n1  66-enable sshd   Now we can look at the contents of the service script with:\n1  66-inservice sshd   Name : sshd\rVersion : 0.2.1\rIn tree : Status : Type : classic\rDescription : ssh daemon\rSource : /usr/lib/66/service/sshd\rLive : /run/66/scandir/0/sshd\rDependencies : sshd-log\rExternal dependencies : None\rOptional dependencies : None\rStart script : foreground { exec

services have to be added to a tree before starting; the tree codifies the services' dependencies.\nTo see and manipulate the trees, the 66-intree command is used (from 66 version 0.6x onwards)\nI find the -g switch very useful, since it shows the dependency structure of the services that are configured in the trees.\n1  66-intree -g   Name : boot\rInitialized : yes\rEnabled : no\rStarts after

to manage the dependencies of services in a slightly more intuitive way than the classic numbered scripts of SysV-init, but they are very far from the ease of use of SystemD\u0026rsquo;s service units, which are declarative.\nIn addition, the installation and configuration of SystemD\u0026rsquo;s service units is automated most of the time by the package managers of SystemD-supporting distros, and by being declarative, all that\u0026rsquo;s needed is to create the service unit and then SystemD will take charge of extracting the dependencies and parallelism in the configured services. Although 66 supports the parallel startup of services through the use of trees, it still falls to the administrator to define exactly the starting order of each service.\nFor those wanting more control over the boot process than what\u0026rsquo;s offered by SystemD, it\u0026rsquo;s great, or at least less work-intensive than SysV-init. 66\u0026rsquo;s scripts do help, but not much.\nOf course what S6, OpenRC, Runit, etc, are missing, are the thousands of hours of programming that were invested on SystemD and quantity in this case has a quality in itself. In comparison, all these inits are a cake which is missing the yeast to rise.\nIf you are interested in contributing to this project, they need you.\n","description":"A(nother) SystemD alternative","id":0,"section":"unixlike","tags":null,"title":"S6-init on Obarun","uri":"https://tiagojsilva.github.io/en/unixlike/meme/arch_manjaro/2021-12-02_obarun-install/"},{"content":"OpenSSL-based PKI (part 1) Sources:\nhttps://openssl-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\nhttps://www.golinuxcloud.com/tutorial-pki-certificates-authority-ocsp/\nhttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2900.offline-root-certification-authority-ca.aspx\nhttps://pki-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\nAn airgapped Root CA The system that contains the RootCA is supposed to be airgapped, to be under controlled access, and to be used only for the emission of new CAs and revocation of compromised CAs.

if we do not configure Certificate Revocation now, it will be too late to be included in any certificate created by our RootCA.\nHow to revoke a certificate 1 2 3 4 5 6  stamp=$(date +%F_%T) mv /root/ca/inter-ca/certs/example-ca.cert.pem{,-revoked_$stamp} openssl ca -config /root/ca/openssl.cnf \\ -passin file:/root/ca/private/ca.key.pass \\ -revoke /root/ca/inter-ca/certs/example-ca.cert.pem-revoked_$stamp \\ -crl_reason unspecified   -crl_reason can also have the values keyCompromise, CACompromise, affiliationChanged, superseded, cessationOfOperation, certificateHold, or (for Delta-CRLs only) removeFromCRL\n-crl_hold automatically places the reason as certificateHold but that\u0026rsquo;s outside the scope of this document\n-crl_compromise AAAAMMDDHHMMSSZ sets the reason as keyCompromise on the suppied date.\n-crl_CA_compromise AAAAMMDDHHMMSSZ does the same, but the reason is CACompromise\nWe need to set up a mechanism for the RootCA to disseminate the information of the revoked certificates, and this needs to be done before creating any subsequent certificate, by adding information to the RootCA\u0026rsquo;s openssl.cnf before de creating any certificate (up to and including other CAs).\nCRL distribution The classic method is the direct distribution of the CRL lists, which can be done by various means, such as an HTTP server, an LDAP or AD directory, etc.; there may still be an additional complication because to avoid the constant transmission of large files you can use Delta-CRLs containing only the changes to the CRL, but while these can be implemented in Windows or other PKI packages, they are not available on OpenSSL.\nThese lists are usually updated (because they expire and all CA certificates are no longer accepted) at a maximum of every 30 days, but the RootCA\u0026rsquo;s CRL list should not expire (or expire only annually when it is time to update the system that hosts the RootCA).\n[CA_default]\rdefault_crl_days = 385\rAt that time, the CRL is refreshed and (in the case of an airgapped RootCA system) extracted on paper, QR Code, CD-R or other safe medium, then taken to the system from where it will be distributed.\nThe distribution format of these lists is DER (binary coding), but the file must have a .CRL extension (RFC 2585).\nThe other method, more recommended these days, is using an OCSP Responder to answer queries about the validity of a certificate interactively, which is a quick operation that does not require much bandwidth, certifies the revocation by signing it with a key from the originator CA, and that answer can be cached on the clients (through OCSP Stapling).\nAs the RootCA\u0026rsquo;s CRL will contain very few certificates (the RootCA will only issue other CAs, called IntermediateCAs, SubordinateCAs ou\nSigningCAs, which won\u0026rsquo;t be many), let\u0026rsquo;s set up a CRLDistribution package for the RootCA.\nWe begin by putting the information from where the CRL will be served on the [ v3_intermediate_ca ] section of /root/ca/openssl.cnf, to be\nIncluded in any certificates issued by the RootCA. We will use an HTTP server on port 7788:\n[ v3_intermediate_ca ]\rcrlDistributionPoints = URI:http://server.tjs.lan:7788/root-ca.crl\rWe create the CRL (https://blog.didierstevens.com/2013/05/08/howto-make-your-own-cert-and-revocation-list-with-openssl/)\n1 2 3 4  openssl ca -config /root/ca/openssl.cnf -gencrl \\ -passin file:/root/ca/private/ca.key.pass \\ -keyfile /root/ca/private/ca.key.pem -cert /root/ca/certs/ca.cert.pem \\ -out /root/ca/crl/ca.crl.pem   We verify the contents of the CRL:\n1  openssl crl -in /root/ca/crl/ca.crl.pem -noout -text   Certificate Revocation List (CRL):\rVersion 2 (0x1)\rSignature Algorithm: sha512WithRSAEncryption\rIssuer: C = PT, ST = Lisboa, L = Lisboa, O = TiagoJoaoSilva, OU = TJS, CN = ca-tjs-1, emailAddress = bofh@tjs.lan\rLast Update: Aug 13 23:46:07 2021 GMT\rNext Update: Sep 2 23:46:07 2022 GMT\rCRL extensions:\rX509v3 Authority Key Identifier:\rkeyid:01:F2:CC:54:E0:F2:58:AC:E2:14:8E:2B:DB:6D:B6:FF:5C:25:41:A0\rX509v3 CRL Number:\r4097\rRevoked Certificates:\rSerial Number: 1001\rRevocation Date: Aug 13 22:11:25 2021 GMT\rCRL entry extensions:\rX509v3 CRL Reason Code:\rUnspecified\rSerial Number: 1002\rRevocation Date: Aug 13 23:41:51 2021 GMT\rCRL entry extensions:\rX509v3 CRL Reason Code:\rSuperseded\rSignature Algorithm: sha512WithRSAEncryption [...]\r\nAnd we need to convert the PEM (Base64) into DER format:\n1 2  # openssl crl -inform PEM -in /root/ca/crl/ca.crl.pem \\ -outform DER -out /root/ca/crl/root-ca.crl   Network-connected system Since the RootCA should be airgapped and offline, it is not on the RootCA\u0026rsquo;s system that we should configure the CRL\u0026rsquo;s distribution because that system must be accessible on the network.\nWe set up a new Debian 11 system, and recreate the folder that contains the RootCA\u0026rsquo;s CRL:\n1  mkdir -p /root/ca/crl   We bring the root-ca.crl file to it using a safe mechanism (burn a CD-R, printing and scanning with OCR, etc.) e place it in /root/ca/crl\nInstall and configure the CRLDistribution webserver Let\u0026rsquo;s use a very basic webserver, lighttpd\n1  apt install lighttpd -y   According to Debian\u0026rsquo;s wiki about Lighttpd, the default installation configures the service, grabs the 80/TCP port, runs with the wser www-data, set the webroot to be /var/www/html, and the default file to be index.php or  index.html, although it comes pre-configured to not run .php files.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s set up a different port (7788), another webroot to not interfere with the defaults from other webservers, and we will disable the automatic redirection to index.html\nIn addition, and this can be important, the MIME type settings have been pre-configured with a Perl script, which we may have to edit and re-do because the CRL files have to be served by HTTP with a specific MIME type, application/pkix-crl\n(https://pki-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mime.html)\n1  cp /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf{,.orig}   Change the lines:\n 1 server.modules = (\r2 # \u0026quot;mod_indexfile\u0026quot;,\r3 # \u0026quot;mod_access\u0026quot;,\r4 # \u0026quot;mod_alias\u0026quot;,\r5 # \u0026quot;mod_redirect\u0026quot;,\r6 )\r8 server.document-root = \u0026quot;/var/www/crl\u0026quot;\r10 server.errorlog = \u0026quot;/var/log/lighttpd/crl-error.log\u0026quot;\r14 server.port = 7788\r41 #index-file.names = ( \u0026quot;index.php\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;index.html\u0026quot;

For example, it is impossible to revoke webserver certificates by CRLDistribution because only Internet Explorer has the code to download and analyze a CRL (Firefox and Chrome don\u0026rsquo;t even care) https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/05/13/how-certificate-revocation-doesnt-work-in-practice.html . That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s safer to set up the alternative mechanism, which is an OCSP Responder, also called AIA due to the directive that configures it ( AuthorityInfoAccess).\nSetting up the OCSP Responder on the RootCA\u0026rsquo;s CNF We start by placing on the RootCA\u0026rsquo;s openssl.cnf the following, on the [ intermediate_ca ] section:\nauthorityInfoAccess = OCSP;URI:http://ocsp.tjs.lan:7899\rWe can use any TCP port for the OCSP Responder, and it\u0026rsquo;s usually listening on a seldom-used HTTP port (like 8008). I chose port 7899 because after analyzing IANA\u0026rsquo;s port list, TCP ports 7888-7899 are not assigned, and may be used for this purpose. If we weren\u0026rsquo;t using CRLD, Lighttpd could also be switched off and port 7788 reused.\nThe protocol is HTTP and not HTTPS because how would any OCSP\u0026rsquo;s SSL Certificate be checked? (https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/c65e1784-39be-4732-a135-bfba7446ad05/should-the-ocsp-responder-service-be-running-http-80-or-https-443-) The configuration of an OCSP Responder will be documented in the next part, which will about configuring an IntermediateCA. But we left the information in the RootCA\u0026rsquo;s .CNF in case we want to implement an OCSP Responder later.\nNote: if this information is not configured now, it can only be introduced on the PKI (and passed to any downstream certificates issued by the RootCA) by revoking and re-issuing all certificates already issued; therefore the structure of a PKI should be very well-planned before being implemented.\nNow we can start the IntermediateCA\u0026rsquo;s configuration.\n","description":"PKI in OpenSSL: part 1 (RootCA)","id":1,"section":"sec","tags":null,"title":"PKI OpenSSL (pt 1)","uri":"https://tiagojsilva.github.io/en/sec/pki/opensslpki_1/"},{"content":"Some time ago, I needed to simulate a heterogeneous network, with a Cisco router connected to another Huawei router.\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t easy because IOS is not publicly available and the Huawei simulator, eNSP, is discontinued and only works on VirtualBox 5.\nTo make this simulation, a CPU that supports VM nesting (Second-Level Address Translation - SLAT) is required.\nSimulation VM Create a Windows 7-based VM, with 4GB of RAM, 2 vCPUS and 4 network interfaces.It may be possible to lower RAM for 2GB, but this has not been tested; 1GB has been tested and is insufficient.\n\r\rIn order for the ARP protocol of the simulated routers to not complain that there are duplicate IPs in different MACs, it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to do MAC Spoofing on purpose, placing in the MAC configuration of each VirtualBox interface the MAC of the simulated router interface that it will represent. First the MAC is left in the standard setting, and then after we raise the simulated routers we take note of the MAC of each router\u0026rsquo;s interface, switch off the VM, and introduces this MAC in the corresponding VirtualBox interface configuration before bringing back the VM.\nCisco\u0026rsquo;s simulated router can change its MACs to duplicate the default VirtualBox MACs, so this step is optional for the Cisco\u0026rsquo;s interfaces; the same is supposed to be possible in the Huawei router, but although it is described in the manual, the simulation of the AR2220 can not change its MACs, so this step is required for the simulated Huawei router to work.\nThe final settings are:\nVirtual Interface 1  Internal Network: WAN Promiscuous: Allow All  Virtual Interface 2  Internal Network: LAN Promiscuous: Allow All  Virtual Interface 3  Internal Network: WAN Always with the same MAC as the corresponding external interface of the Huawei router Promiscuous: Allow All  Virtual Interface 4  Internal Network: LAN Always with the same MAC as the corresponding external interface of the Huawei router Promiscuous: Allow All\n\r\r  Guest\u0026rsquo;s network configuration Control Panel, Network Connections\nVirtual Interface 1\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; interface (confirm, for example, by disconnecting the virtual network cable)\nName: C-Outside or Cisco-EXT\nIP: 10.5.222.4\nNetmask: 255.255.0.0\nGateway: \u0026ndash;\nVirtual Interface 2\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; interface Name: C-Inside or Cisco-INT\nIP: 10.10.0.58\nNetmask: 255.255.255.248\nGateway: \u0026ndash;\nVirtual Interface 3\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; interface Name: H-Outside or Huawei-EXT\nIP: 10.5.222.6\nNetmask: 255.255.0.0\nGateway: \u0026ndash;\nVirtual Interface 4\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; interface Name: H-Inside or Huawei-INT\nIP: 10.10.0.59\nNetmask: 255.255.255.248\nGateway: \u0026ndash;\nSoftware to install  VirtualBox 5.2.x and its Extension Pack Winpcap 4.1.3 Wireshark-win64 3.2.5 eNSP V100R002C00B510 Setup GNS3 2.2.x or higher (don\u0026rsquo;t install GNS3 VM)  Finish the simulation VM\u0026rsquo;s configuration Save all projects, close all programs, turn off the VM (Shutdown)\nOn the VM\u0026rsquo;s Network properties, change each virtual interface\u0026rsquo;s MAC address to the same MAC of the router port that will connect to it \r\rBoot the VM up again, open the projects and configure the routers.\nGNS3 setup for Cisco 7200 Router Simulation Create a template for the Cisco 7200 Click on the first option of the bar on the left, Browse Routers\n+ New template\n\r\rInstall appliance from server\nNext\nPick Routers \u0026gt; Cisco 7200 / Dynamips\nInstall\n\r\rInstall on this computer\nNext\nAllow custom files\nOn the warning *Do you want to proceed?

So when I tried again to logon to the Client computer, I got in, and the user\u0026rsquo;s GPOs were applied.\nSolving the same issue on RSAT was a tad more involved; first I had to take the computer out of the domain using the GUI (Computer Preferences as local Administrator), and then I was able to open an Admin PowerShell and use the commands:\n1 2  Add-Computer -Credential DASILVAT\\Administrator -Domain DASILVAT Restart-Computer   However, I began to see another problem in samba-ad-dc\u0026rsquo;s log; maybe because I refreshed the sysvol ACLs, now the error comes from the shares' permissions:\nchdir_current_service: vfs_ChDir(/mnt/dumdum/recursos) failed: Permission denied.

Not ideal.\nOn the other hand, it\u0026rsquo;s not proposed to locally clone the repository, and the only suggestion is downloading the script with curl. Even less ideal, and plainly insecure.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s repeat the safer process, as we did for Rocky.\nOpen a root shell e clone the repo:\n1 2 3  git clone https://github.com/AlmaLinux/almalinux-deploy.git chmod u+x ./almalinux-deploy/almalinux-deploy.sh ./almalinux-deploy/almalinux-deploy.sh   Check root privileges OK\rCheck centos-8.x86_64 is supported OK\rDownload RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux OK\rImport RPM-GPG-KEY-AlmaLinux to RPM DB OK\rDownload almalinux-release package OK\rVerify almalinux-release package OK\rYour OS is supported OK\rRemove OS specific rpm packages OK\r[...]\rAll Secure Boot related packages which were released by not AlmaLinux are reinstalledOK\rMigration to AlmaLinux is completed\r And restart the TJGGS server\n\r\r\r\r\r\rAgain, I created a new user with RSAT, now on the Active Directory of the AlmaLinux-migrated server.\n\r\rThis new user also logged in to the domain from the client computer, with the GPOs applied correctly (minus the printer):\n\r\rFinal thoughts As promised, both Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux were able to make the sidegrade of a Centos8 server with some services (samba-ad-dc, chrony, mdm RAIDs, SSHd) without major issues.\nThe initial problems with permissions were certainly caused by me during the initial configuration of the server, because I remember that I had problems with the permissions of the sysvol which prevented some GPOs from working properly; basically the problem went on for this long (but no more, hopefully).\nEditorial The Free and Open Source world has always experienced a problem caused by \u0026ldquo;Free as in Freedom\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Free as in Beer\u0026rdquo;. And if Being Free has a relative value for a lot of people, Being For Free is a much larger attractive and it can be measured directly, so the FOSS world, at least in its early years, did little to stress that of the two possibilities, Freedom is FOSS\u0026rsquo;s main objective.\nObviously nothing is \u0026ldquo;for free\u0026rdquo; (free lunches and all that), everything has a cost and if we aren\u0026rsquo;t paying, someone else is paying for us, whether in human effort, CPU cycles, storage, connectivity, energy, hardware… So when FOSS projects reach some maturity and market position, they try to entice users to contribute something (anything!) that benefits the project directly, more than mere disclosure and promotion.\nIn this way, the companies behind many FOSS projects sell services and support, but are also closing certain conveniences behind these contracts, to instill users to pay money for the FOSS product. These extra conveniences (beyond simple support) usually are:\n Limited functionality: certain functions which add value in an enterprise setting are developed on a non-FOSS model and are only unlocked against payment of a license or purchase of packaged hardware  OPNsense, among others; notably, almost all providers of ZFS-based storage appliances (like TrueNAS) lock clustering and High-Availability behind the purchase of hardware bundled with the FOSS software.   Access to updates: only the binaries of version x.0.0 are publicly available, and any updates in the form of pre-compiled binaries are only available for users with a Support Agreement; however, usually the FOSS license used mandates acess to all source code, which allows anyone that is up to it to try to compile the update.  Bareos, OPNsense work like this   Access to stable versions: as a complete reversal of the previous option, only the nightly build of the actual state of the development process is made publicly available, without any type of functionality tests (except the assurance that the build didn\u0026rsquo;t break); in this case, to get a stable(r) version it\u0026rsquo;s safer to get the source for the nightly of the previous major version, which will be better tested and whose updates should be just bug fixes - but even then, without any testing for regressions.  VyOS    RedHat decided to use a variant of this last option: instead of only making the CentOS nightlies available, which they knew was too much (and they already had Fedora Rawhide for that), they decided that CentOS would be accessible only as the development branch of the next minor version of RHEL\n Instead of CentOS version 8.4 being released after RHEL 8.4, while RHEL is at 8.4 CentOS Stream will be testing the next version 8.5; and only when CentOS Stream 8.5 is found to be stable it will be converted into RHEL 8.5, while CentOS Stream proceeds with testing the corrections slated for 8.6. Even better, whoever wants to test the features of RHEL 9, can already try to install CentOS Stream 9\u0026hellip; In this way, users of CentOS will be contributing with testing (and hopefully bug reports), therefore paying something for their use of code developed and packaged by RedHat.

BIND, just like the OpenSSH we installed in the article about the initial installation of TinyCoreLinux (link at the top of this article), has a management script (in this case, bind) which the extension installs automatically in /usr/local/etc/init.d/\n1  /usr/local/etc/init.d/bind   usage /usr/local/etc/init.d/bind start|stop|reload|restart|status\r This way, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to write our own script5 nor try to adapt the OpenSSH script.\nThis script, due to the way the extensions are mounted on the system, can not be changed; to make the necessary changes, we need, first of all, to copy it to a permanent location where we have write permissions.\nThe original placement of the script is /usr/local/etc/init.d/, so a logical place would be /opt/local/etc/init.d/\n1  mkdir /opt/local/etc/init.d   And we must copy while breaking the symlink that points to the real location where TinyCore has mounted the extension, cto make sure we copy the real file and not the symlink:\n1  sudo cp -aL /usr/local/etc/init.d/bind /opt/local/etc/init.d/   Add the new script location to PATH, so we don\u0026rsquo;t have to write the full path when we want to run one of these scripts:\n1 2 3  echo \u0026#39;export PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH:/opt/local/etc/init.d/\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.ashrc sudo echo \u0026#39;export PATH=\u0026#34;$PATH:/opt/local/etc/init.d/\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /root/.ashrc filetool.sh -b   Now we can make changes to the script, namely the variable NAMED_OPTIONS. But first of all, we need to create, by hand, the user and group that will administer BIND (named), because a TCZ extension is just a set of files and won\u0026rsquo;t touch system files.\nUser and group for the service The script expects a specific user, named, that is used specifically to run the service. To make it6:\n1 2  sudo addgroup named -g 2000 sudo adduser named -u 2000 -G named -DH -s /bin/false   Set /etc/passwd and /etc/group as persistent:\n1 2  echo \u0026#34;etc/passwd\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/.filetool.lst echo \u0026#34;etc/group\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/.filetool.lst \u0026amp;\u0026amp; filetool.sh -b   Change the permissions:\n1 2  sudo chown -R named:named /opt/local/etc/bind sudo chmod -R 660 /opt/local/etc/bind   When using the named user, BIND will try to use the folder /var/run/named, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. We must make that folder and make it persistent:\n1 2 3  mkdir /var/run/named sudo chown named:named /var/run/named echo \u0026#34;var/run/named\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/.filetool.lst \u0026amp;\u0026amp; filetool.sh -b   On our current command that starts the service, our options were -4 (IPv4 only) and -c /opt/local/etc/bin/named.conf (path to the configuration file); those are the arguments that we must add to NAMED_OPTIONS on the /opt/local/etc/init.d/bind script (along with the nameduser):\nNAMED_OPTIONS=\u0026quot;-u named -4 -c /opt/local/etc/bind/named.conf\u0026quot;\rSave and exit.\nSetup BIND management with RNDC However, the service startup script also depends on the control utility rndc7, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t come assembled and ready to run, because This\u0026hellip; Is\u0026hellip; CoreLinux\u0026hellip;\nGenerate the key that authorizes rndc to give commands to bind and make it persistent\n1 2 3 4  sudo rndc-confgen -a sudo chown root:staff /usr/local/etc/rndc.key sudo chmod 640 /usr/local/etc/rndc.key echo \u0026#34;usr/local/etc/rndc.key\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/.filetool.lst \u0026amp;\u0026amp; filetool.sh -b   Use this command to generate a template configuration:\n1 2  sudo rndc-confgen \u0026gt; /opt/local/etc/bind/rndc.out sudo cat /opt/local/etc/bind/rndc.out   # Start of rndc.conf\rkey \"rndc-key\" {\ralgorithm hmac-sha256;\rsecret \"qXe5NgimFUmfztOZXJG4XXjkZJX0AdUEcTgci3+m38s=\";\r};\roptions {\rdefault-key \"rndc-key\";\rdefault-server 127.0.0.1;\rdefault-port 953;\r};\r# End of rndc.conf\r# Use with the following in named.conf, adjusting the allow list as needed:\r# key \"rndc-key\" {\r# algorithm hmac-sha256;\r# secret \"qXe5NgimFUmfztOZXJG4XXjkZJX0AdUEcTgci3+m38s=\";\r# };\r#\r# controls {\r# inet 127.0.0.1 port 953\r# allow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { \"rndc-key\"; };\r# };\r# End of named.conf\r On /opt/local/etc/bind/named.conf, add the instructions required to use rndc, following the example of the comment block above.\nFirst, add the contents of rndc.key\n1  sudo cat /usr/local/etc/rndc.key \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/local/etc/bind/named.conf   Then add the following to /opt/local/etc/bind/named.conf\ncontrols {\rinet 127.0.0.1 port 953\rallow { 127.0.0.1; } keys { \u0026quot;rndc-key\u0026quot;; };\r};\rTo test,\n1 2 3  sudo killall named /usr/local/sbin/named -u named -4 -c /opt/local/etc/bind/named.conf \u0026amp; rndc status   version: BIND 9.16.3 (Stable Release) \rrunning on verynice: Linux i686 5.4.3-tinycore #2020 SMP Tue Dec 17 17:00:50 UTC 2019\rboot time: Sun, 06 Sep 2020 00:54:14 GMT\rlast configured: Sun, 06 Sep 2020 00:54:16 GMT\rconfiguration file: /opt/local/etc/bind/named.conf\rCPUs found: 1\rworker threads: 1\rUDP listeners per interface: 1\rnumber of zones: 106 (97 automatic)\rdebug level: 0\rxfers running: 0\rxfers deferred: 0\rsoa queries in progress: 0\rquery logging is OFF\rrecursive clients: 0/900/1000\rtcp clients: 0/150\rTCP high-water: 0\rserver is up and running\r Now we can go to /opt/bootlocal.sh and change the service activation line from the raw command to the init script.

I\u0026rsquo;ll use the Deluxe version, CorePlus, with leather seats, GUI and possibility of disk installation, but there are leaner flavors of CoreLinux that will cheerfully boot from a 128MB flashdrive and load themselves to a RAMdrive at startup.\nIt works in a very particular way because the core system is completely separated from the applications and settings and these are only applied at the following boot if they are explicitly stored.\nVery few concessions are made to convenience and user-friendliness, the default shell (busybox)2 is extremely simplified in comparison to a normal Linux distribution and management utilities are just like UNIX/Linux ten years ago.\nInstallation Download from TinyCore\u0026rsquo;s main site the CorePlus installer\nPlace the ISO on the VM\u0026rsquo;s virtual optical drive and start it.\nPick the default option, FLWM topside\n\r\rAt the dock on the bottom of the screen, open the tc-install3 application.\n\r\rPick Frugal, Whole disk, and then, sda. Confirm that Install boot loader is enabled. Click on \u0026gt;\n\r\rFormatting Options: ext4 \u0026gt;\n\r\rBoot options to add to the installer (check the on-screen list, or Chapter 10 of the Official Tiny Core Linux book, Into the Core):\ntce=sda1 home=sda1 opt=sda1 nodhcp showapps safebackup cron syslog host=verynice kmap=qwerty/pt-latin1.kmap\r(Change the hostname and keymap to something more appropriate for you, obviously)\nThe keyboard will be in US layout, so =, « and / will be on different keys if that\u0026rsquo;s not your actual layout.\r\nClick on \u0026gt;\n\r\rInstall type I chose Core and X/GUI Desktop but when following this guide, you may not need the GUI and be able to choose Core Only\nThe only extension to install right now is Non-US keyboard layout support (if you need it)\nClick on \u0026gt;\n\r\rActually, after having CoreLinux installed and the network configured, this extension can be installed quite easily from the extension manager, so it\u0026rsquo;s really not required to use the CorePlus installer to have international keymaps, and a lighter installer would be enough. But this is the most general case.\nThe same may not be true for support for Wi-Fi cards, which is also chosen on this panel but which I haven\u0026rsquo;t tested.\nReview the settings and click Proceed\n\r\rClick on the Exit icon on the dock, pick Shutdown, OK\n\r\rWhen the installtion completes, remove the ISO from the optical drive and reboot the VM.\nInitial Settings Changing boot options To change the boot options, edit /mnt/sda1/tce/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf and make your changes to the APPEND line.\nNon-US keyboard Open a terminal and test a key that\u0026rsquo;s specific to the layout you specified; if the result isn\u0026rsquo;t what you expected (the kmap boot option isn\u0026rsquo;t being followed), use the commands:\n1 2 3  echo \u0026#39;loadkmap \u0026lt; /usr/share/kmap/qwerty/\u0026lt;your_layout\u0026gt;.kmap\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/bootsync.sh filetool.sh -b sudo reboot   \r\r\rSet up Permanence Without this step, TinyCoreLinux will not automatically save the changes we make to the configuration because after each restart, all settings are lost except those that we tell it to save (which can be both good, or bad).\nThe steps below configure the automatic saving of the existing settings on system shutdown using the script that is run automatically by the system before shutting down:\n1  vi /opt/shutdown.sh   Beneath the #put user shutdown commands here line, add:\n1  filetool.sh -b   Save and exit. The command to force the recording of this change is, of course,\n1  filetool.sh -b   Change the default user\u0026rsquo;s (tc) password 1  passwd   Pick a password.\nAdd a config file to the Permanence list To save a configuration file, like the password file, after a restart (giving it permanence), the file path to save, minus the leading /, has to be placed in /opt/.filetool.lst\n1 2  sudo echo \u0026#39;etc/shadow\u0026#39; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/.filetool.lst filetool.sh -b   Network To configure a network interface in a flavor of CoreLinux with a GUI, use the command sudo network in a terminal window (the following values are just for illustrative purposes):\nInterface: eth0\nDHCP Broadcast: no\nIP Address: 10.123.130.6\nNet mask: 255.255.255.248\nBroadcast: 10.123.130.7\nGateway: 10.123.130.1\nNameServers: 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8\nSave Configuration: yes\nApply\n\r\rTest with ping 1.1.1.1\nConfirm the settings with cat /opt/eth0.sh\n#!/bin/sh\rpkill udhcpc\rifconfig eth0 10.123.130.6 netmask 255.255.255.248 broadcast 10.123.130.7 up\rroute add default gw 10.123.130.1\recho nameserver 1.1.1.1  /etc/resolv.conf\recho nameserver 8.8.8.8  /etc/resolv.conf\r\nTo configure the network without having access to the GUI, simply copy the above information to /opt/eth0.sh\nConfirm that /opt/eth0.sh has been added to the Permanence with:\n1  cat /opt/.filetool.lst | grep eth0   opt/eth0.sh\r\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s not,\n1  echo \u0026#34;opt/eth0.sh\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/.filetool.lst \u0026amp;\u0026amp; filetool.sh -b   Aliases The aliases of the default user (tc) are in ~/.ashrc.

In this case we want the tzdata.tcz extension (Time Zone data.TCextension Zipped)\n1  tce-fetch.sh tzdata.tcz   CoreLinux can mount extensions directly for reading (as a matter of fact, that how it \u0026ldquo;installs\u0026rdquo; an extension).

For example, coreutils.tcz installs the most-used GNU/POSIX commands in their full versions, replacing the ones integrated on busybox, and bash.tcz replaces busybox itself (but since TinyCore makes no concession to user-friendliness, we have to edit /etc/passwd and change the user\u0026rsquo;s login shell, set /etc/passwd to be permanent, and roll the backup)\nSetting up vim 1 2  cd ~ vim .vimrc   Set the file up with the desired options (and since it\u0026rsquo;s located in /home/tc/, the boot options we provided, specifically home=sda1, will automatically make the file permanent).\nSuggestions for a .vimrc can be found on the Dotfiles page.\nAfter customizing to our taste, having the same options when editing a file as root would be nice. To accomplish that, copy the .vimrc to root\u0026rsquo;s home folder:\n1 2  sudo cp /home/tc/.vimrc /root sudo chown root:root /root/.vimrc   (Check the Aliases section for how to add /root to the Permanence, if it\u0026rsquo;s not already there)\nNTP client If the system clock isn\u0026rsquo;t correct the communication between any local services and WAN servers can be refused by the latter. And on a VirtualBox VM without GuestAdditions, the clock will be wrong most of the time.\nDespite the existence of a chrony extension for TinyCore, I used a very basic NTP client4, because I was interested in as lean a system as possible.\n1  tce-load -wi ntpclient.tcz   Downloading: ntpclient.tcz\rConnecting to repo.tinycorelinux.net (89.22.99.37:80)\rsaving to 'ntpclient.tcz'\rntpclient.tcz 100% |********************************| 12288 0:00:00 ETA\r'ntpclient.tcz' saved\rntpclient.tcz: OK\r Configure the client Place on /opt/bootlocal.sh three instructions with very different tasks:\n1) Update the time while booting up5 If we don\u0026rsquo;t have DNS available at this stage, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to use straight IP addresses instead of hostnames, so we can\u0026rsquo;t use a pool address. My recommendation in that case is to ask the time to your country\u0026rsquo;s Official Time servers (the example uses the addresses of the Portuguese Official Time servers)5\n1  echo \u0026#34;ntpclient -c 1 -s -t -h 194.117.47.42 || ntpclient -c 1 -s -t -h 194.117.47.44\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/bootlocal.sh   2) Update the Real-Time Clock (RTC) TinyCore, until told otherwise, will ignore the NTP time and will always get the time from the hardware clock, which in the case of VirtualBox without Guest Additions, can\u0026rsquo;t ask the VM host for the current time and boots with the same time the VM was last turned off. So after we receive the system time from an NTP server, we must update the hardware clock with hwclock -w\n1  echo \u0026#34;hwclock -w\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/bootlocal.sh   3) Correct any time drift Then we need to ensure that the clock won\u0026rsquo;t drift from the correct time while the system is up, by starting a process that checks the time at regular intervals6\n1  echo \u0026#34;/usr/local/bin/ntpclient -c 0 -l -t -i 300 -h 3.pt.pool.ntp.org \u0026amp;\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /opt/bootlocal.sh   In case of a reboot, the clock will jump forward one hour, but running the first two commands manually at the end of the boot process the system time is immediately corrected. I can\u0026rsquo;t tell if it\u0026rsquo;s a bug, but I tried all the combinations of UTC and localtime on Virtualbox and TinyCore nothing solved this.\nFrom a cold boot, these settings work well.\r Final thoughts TinyCoreLinux is very small, but this has its costs.\nEverything must be configured, and everything has to be defined as persistent.\nIt behaves more like a container than a regular system install; it has good company, because AlpineLinux works under the same principles, and is also very popular as a container base (being the default container base on Docker) and on embedded systems.\nHowever, it seems to me that Tinycore is beginning to be too much work for what resources it saves. Usually we\u0026rsquo;re not that desperate any more.\nFor a really minimalist system, there is an even more reduced version, MicroCoreLinux (or simply Core), without any GUI and just 8MB.\nFor something that would allow me to be productive quickly, I have high hopes for AlpineLinux, which I\u0026rsquo;ll try to test very soon.\n http://distro.ibiblio.org/tinycorelinux/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://busybox.net/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n http://tinycorelinux.net/install.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n -c = count \u0026lt;times\u0026gt;; -s = set; -t = trust; -h = host \u0026lt;address_server_NTP\u0026gt;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n http://oal.ul.pt/hora-legal/como-acertar/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n -c 0 = no limit on tries; -l = lock; -i = interval ; this command uses hostnames and assumes DNS resolution is available\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","description":"Pocket Jawbreaker","id":8,"section":"unixlike","tags":null,"title":"TinyCore Linux - Initial steps","uri":"https://tiagojsilva.github.io/en/unixlike/meme/2021-10-29_tinycorelinux-install/"},{"content":"The first time I tried to set up a Copy button for code boxes, I left an issue on Zdoc\u0026rsquo;s GitHub.\nSome days ago, another Zdoc user published the solution that worked for him, and stimulated by that, I tried again.\nUnfortunately, I must have manipulated my theme\u0026rsquo;s DOM code too much (tracking upstream is going to be impossible until I nuke it and pave it on the next Zdoc release) to be able to use his code, but I tried fiddling a little more with the code I had tried to use previously, which was based on this proposal by Tom Spencer.\nWith my changes, it ended up like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53  // insert just before the \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; tag // tomspencer, https://www.tomspencer.dev/blog/2018/09/14/adding-click-to-copy-buttons-to-a-hugo-powered-blog/ (function() { \u0026#39;use strict\u0026#39;; if(!document.queryCommandSupported(\u0026#39;copy\u0026#39;)) { return; } function flashCopyMessage(el, msg) { el.textContent = msg; setTimeout(function() { el.textContent = \u0026#34;COPY\u0026#34;; }, 1000); } function selectText(node) { var selection = window.getSelection(); var range = document.createRange(); range.selectNodeContents(node); selection.removeAllRanges(); selection.addRange(range); return selection; } function addCopyButton(containerEl) { var copyBtn = document.createElement(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;); copyBtn.className = \u0026#34;highlight-copy-btn\u0026#34;; copyBtn.textContent = \u0026#34;COPY\u0026#34;; var codeEl = containerEl.firstElementChild; copyBtn.addEventListener(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;, function() { try { var selection = selectText(codeEl); document.execCommand(\u0026#39;copy\u0026#39;); selection.removeAllRanges(); flashCopyMessage(copyBtn, \u0026#39;Copied!\u0026#39;) } catch(e) { console \u0026amp;\u0026amp; console.log(e); flashCopyMessage(copyBtn, \u0026#39;Failed :\\\u0026#39;(\u0026#39;) } }); containerEl.appendChild(copyBtn); } // Add copy button to code blocks var highlightBlocks = document.getElementsByClassName(\u0026#39;highlight\u0026#39;); for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; highlightBlocks.length; i++) { addCopyButton(highlightBlocks[i]); } })();   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36  .highlight-copy-btn { position: relative; bottom: 22px; right: 0px; border: 0; border-radius: 4px; padding: 1px; font-size: 0.6em; line-height: 1.0; opacity: 0.6; min-width: 65px; text-align: center; letter-spacing: 2px; @includethemify($codeblock) { color: themed(\u0026#39;content-pre-color\u0026#39;); background: themed(\u0026#39;content-pre-background-color\u0026#39;); border: 1.25px solid themed(\u0026#39;border-line-color\u0026#39;); } border-top-left-radius: 0; border-top-right-radius: 4px; border-bottom-right-radius: 0; border-bottom-left-radius: 4px; white-space: nowrap; padding: 4px 4px 5px 4px; margin: 0 0 0 1px; cursor: pointer; opacity: 0.6; } .highlight-copy-btn:hover { @includethemify($themes) { color: themed(\u0026#39;link\u0026#39;); background-color: themed(\u0026#39;body-background-color\u0026#39;); } }   It kinda works, but only in code blocks for which a syntax was detected (meaning, div class is highlight and chroma has been activated).

Yes, an SSH connection assumes the client\u0026rsquo;s layout - but you need to setup the network beforehand.\nIncidentally, the entire Debian console configuration system is deactivated or dead. And Debian has its very own way of setting the console up.\nI tried testing backwards and forwards to try to discover the regression point and I realized that:\n It still works in 1.2  But it\u0026rsquo;s no longer advisable to run dpkg-reconfigure from the raw shell, now there\u0026rsquo;s a set console keymap command from Monitor mode ($); all this does is call up dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration and then restart keyboard-setup.service (Vyos is now based on systemd just like the Debian underneath)   In 1.3 and 1.4 it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work  another command has been added, now in Configuration mode (#), set system option keyboard-layout XX, but it only accepts XX=US, DE, FR, DK, NO, FI. This command works, at least for the NO layout (Norway, ou Nordic) which has many keys in common with the PT-pt layout.    Hmmm, I wonder where the main contributors of the project are from?\nBy the way, I also found out that the best way to build Vyos is through the Docker image; I tried to reverse-engineer the dockerfile as recommended by the documentation page, but despite ./configure telling me that the dependencies were all met, the build process was stopped right at the beginning:\nE: The method driver /usr/lib/apt/methods/https could not be found.\rE: Failed to fetch https://repo.saltproject.io/py3/debian/10/amd64/3003/dists/buster/InRelease\rE: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\rP: Begin unmounting filesystems...\rP: Saving caches...\rReading package lists...\rBuilding dependency tree...\rmake: *** [Makefile:32: iso] Error 1\r\nBuilding with the Docker image has been easy, so access to the 1.3 official builds shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be harder than taking the time to build them.\nAs for the keymap problem, my baseless speculation leads me to suspect something in the scripts that build the chroot which is then placed on the ISO. Did they forget debconf console-setup? Some package? The /bin/setupcon file is missing and without it keyboard-setup.service won\u0026rsquo;t work.\nOne of the first things I noticed is that from version 1.3 onwards the characters of the console are the native ones, and not the typical font used by Debian-based distributions; could this be related?\nI opened a thread on the forum, and I\u0026rsquo;ll wait some more time before officially opening a bug in Phabricator.

There was much going on behind the scenes but from the outside all we could see was no new releases.\nHowever, a recent reorganization put wind in their sails and the site has been much improved, looking sharp, professional and organized, the mailing-lists make more sense, and progress seems to be accelerating.\nOn the version I had tested a long time ago (1.0-beta4), Horizon was completely inoperative and I had to use the manual installation method; even now that\u0026rsquo;s an interesting path to take, because it\u0026rsquo;s a good example of how to do bootstrap a Linux system from a binary repository, instead of source code as in Gentoo or LinuxFromScratch, which takes a lot longer.\nTo test the installation, I downloaded the LiveCD for x86_64 with the MATE flavor, but there are also KDE and LXQt options, in ARMv7, ARM64, PPC, PPC64 and x86 architectures.\nI set up an Other Linux (64-bit) VM on VirtualBox (6.1.22) with 1GB of RAM, and defaults for almost everything else.\nGRUB on the LiveCD does not automatically pick an option to boot from, so it\u0026rsquo;s always necessary some interaction, if only hitting Enter, to boot.\r\nIssues, for starters Right on MATE\u0026rsquo;s initial screen the lack of polish is noticeable: clicking on Computer errors out, and the proc e tmp partitions should\u0026rsquo;ve been left hidden.\n\r\rThis may only be cosmetics, but it\u0026rsquo;s but a small appetizer for what awaits us\u0026hellip;\nTo start the HorizonUI installer, Applications \u0026gt; System Tools \u0026gt; System Installation\n\r\rIf you don\u0026rsquo;t want to come on this journey with me and want to start installing right now, do this:\nClose the installer.\nOpen a terminal window: Applications \u0026gt; System Tools \u0026gt; MATE Terminal\nLog in as root: $ su - ; the password is live\n# horizon-ui\r\nMaybe because we\u0026rsquo;ll be running a root application on an X session for a regular user, if PowerManagement shuts the monitor down the VM does not recover and can even crash during installation. Before opening the installer set System \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; Hardware \u0026gt; Power Management \u0026gt; Display Sleep = Never, and in System \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; Look and Feel \u0026gt; Screensaver, turn off Activate when idle and Lock Screen; after the installation starts these configuration panels can\u0026rsquo;t be opened any longer. Both are needed.\nThis was tested in VirtualBox and VMware Workstation/Player\r\nAlso, they are definitely not joking when they say access to WAN is mandatory; none of the packages are installed from the LiveCD, and everything is downloaded from the Adélie repositories.\r\nThe installer looks very much like a wizard:\n\r\rContinue\n Keyboard Layout Load Firmware: Adélie includes non-libre firmware for graphics adapters and Wi-Fi interfaces Select Installation Disk Select partitioning Type: Erase and Use the Whole Disk or Manual (I picked Whole) Networking Setup: Automatic or Manual - and here\u0026rsquo;s the first showstopper, because access to the network is mandatory for installation and this step has a lot where to screw up.\n\r\rIf picking Manual, manually input the IPv4 and IPv6 addressing, but nothing is done to validate if the data is correct; an address in the multicast range and a gateway in Class E are both accepted as valid in this step and the network isn\u0026rsquo;t tested (with a ping to the indicated DNS address, for example):\n\r\rAutomatic means DHCP, of course, and fails to get an address, not even starting a DORA negotiation (Review DHCP Log). And this is all because HorizonUI isn\u0026rsquo;t running with system privileges \u0026hellip;\n\r\rOpening a terminal, we quickly find out that: The LiveCD itself starts without access to the network because DCHP must be activated manually (# dhcpcd eth0) By the way, this also led to the realization that the man help system isn\u0026rsquo;t set up as well (you\u0026rsquo;re on your own, kid!) And finally, even with DHCP working, the eth0 port raised, with an assigned IP and access to the outside, HorizonUI continues to fail in the network configuration step because it wants to do a DORA negotiation (for which it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have permissions) and won\u0026rsquo;t budge until it succeds.\nThe solution is to invoke the installer from the root account (the password is live), with # horizon-ui\n\r\rProceeding with the installation: Date and Time Settings (if we haven\u0026rsquo;t run # horizon-ui, it\u0026rsquo;s not possible to adjust the date and time, only the Timezone is available) Computer Name Software Selection  Standard: installs a complete KDE system (although I\u0026rsquo;ve picked a MATE-flavored LiveCD?) Mobile: KDE as above, but with drivers and settings more suitable for laptops Compact: Very basic LXQt Text-only Custom: as a matter of fact, the only available way for installing MATE\n\r\r   Startup Configuration: if we want to install a bootloader (in this case, yes) Set Root Passphrase User Accounts (you can create several, but you must configure at least one user)\n\r\rAnd at the end of it all, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t followed my initial advice, it breaks again because of missing permissions (in this case, to save the installation script)\n\r\rIf (and only if) the installer was ran as root, the installtion starts:\n\r\rAnd ends:\n\r\rHowever, Finish doesn\u0026rsquo;t restart the system as promised. Which isn\u0026rsquo;t bad because it allows you to do Shutdown, take the ISO off the virtual optical drive and boot back up in an orderly fashion.  Standard A cursory investigation confirms KDE is installed, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even honor the keyboard scheme we chose in the installer; I had chosen pt:\n\r\rMobile Exactly the same as Standard but includes drivers and utilities for peripherals used in laptops, such as trackpads and battery managers; I can\u0026rsquo;t test these features.\nCompact (LXQt and minimal install) Crashes during installation and leaves the system unable to boot; note that after giving the error, I tried to use the LXQt-flavored LiveCD instead of the MATE version to see if it helped, but something seems to be wrong in the repos or in the installation script of the Compact option and it errors while configuring ConsoleFonts (again, the installation on the hard disk depends only on the Horizon script and on Adélie\u0026rsquo;s repos, and the LiveCD is just a graphical environment for the installer)\nOptions used by the Horizon script:\n\r\rInstallation log showing the error:\n\r\rCustom It\u0026rsquo;s the only way of installing MATE or XFCE.\nCustom has more configuration pages:\n Software Selection: package sets to install; detailed below for each case Software Choices: allows choosing three very particular options:  Shell: Dash (POSIX-compatible), ou Bash (GNU-compatible) Init: S6-linux-init (+ OpenRC) (an attempt from the MUSL world to have something similar to SystemD, which only supports GNU Glibc) or SysV Init Uevent: eudev (stable) vs mdevd (more dynamic and modern but unstable) I always picked Bash, S6 e eudev    \r\rSoftware Selection wes set up as:\n☐ Desktop Environments\n ☑ KDE Plasma 5  ☑ Documentation\n☑ Internet Software\nThe image below is from another installation attempt, with MATE selected instead of KDE:\n\r\rAfter installing, it hangs on the first boot; no VTY responds and the login process does not start.\nI have no image because the screenshots came out empty, which made me suspect from an issue with the VirtualBox graphics card (VMSVGA)\nI decided to test the same installation settings in VMware Workstation: the first boot completed successfully, but VTY 7 (where X ususally is) only had a blinking cursor; and startx resulted in not found\nComparing the the installation script options (installfile) between the \u0026ldquo;Standard\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo; installation options, I noticed that on \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo; two fundamental packages for a X system weren\u0026rsquo;t being installed: sddm (managing the GUI login panel and the DE picker) and X11 itself\n\r\rFigure 17. Instalação Standard\r\r\r\r\r\rFigure 18. Instalação Custom\r\r\r\rAnd note that the keyboard configured in the console continued to be US.\nI also tested the \u0026ldquo;Custom\u0026rdquo; installation of MATE (as seen above) and LXQt, with the same results.\nConclusion As much as I have a soft spot for Adélie (I wonder why), using it is an exercise of frustration that reminds me of the worst times at the beginning of Linux (and my first Linux was a RedHat 4.5 - not RHEL, RedHat). Several years of polishing and debugging are still missing, which is the kind of painstaking work no hacker ever wants to do, which the main surviving GNU/Linux distros (Debian, SuSE, RedHat, Arch) have eventually done, and from which all their variants (Ubuntu, Mint, Manjaro, etc.) benefit.\nAt this point, I believe that Adélie can be criticized for:\n offering LiveCDs that aren\u0026rsquo;t functional enough to test the system before installing (I mean, no network access?)  and that do not contain the necessary packages to install a system without online access to Adélie\u0026rsquo;s repos; yes, it would balloon the size of the LiveCD, but that\u0026rsquo;s what a LiveCD is supposed to be   The Standard installation option always installs KDE and not the DE of that LiveCD; again, the LiveCD is supposed to be a faithful preview of what\u0026rsquo;s going to be installed on disk, although it should also be able to run the full custom installer The Custom installation offering alternative DEs doesn\u0026rsquo;t. Not having DHCP active by default, which would fix 90% of user situations (number pulled out of thin air). Not including manpages Not including a copy of the online documentation in the LiveCD The installer can\u0026rsquo;t work from the GUI And all this might not be so serious, if Adélie was a regular GNU/Linux distro, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t.  All this marks Adélie as a distribution only for very advanced users, and, if possible, very experienced with Alpine Linux, which uses the same package manager (APK) and where much of Adélie\u0026rsquo;s userland seems to originate from.\nI submitted some of this information as Issues on Adélie\u0026rsquo;s development site, and if you find more problems I suggest you submit them too; developers are already perfectly adapted to the system but need to know these issues that only happen to the common user who checks the system for the first time.\nThe Adélie project is small and so communication is easy and uncomplicated, so much so that I was able to contact the team, which explained to me that this RC2 version was produced at a very complicated moment in the life of the project for personal reasons of the main programmer (that I understand perfectly, but it is worrying that the distro is so dependent on one person) and that an RC3 version is guaranteed and RC4 is also very likely.\nIn my opinion, they haven\u0026rsquo;t even reached Beta, but nobody cares nowadays, the reality is that version 1.0 will be the Public Beta with a version 1.5 planned for stabilization; which places Adélie Linux in very good company, because OSX had exactly the same pattern of development, even with two decades of prior existence as NextStep/OpenStep - only on OSX 10.2 Jaguar did it become stable enough to be a daily driver without bleeding to death from usability papercuts.\n","description":"Where I pull my hair trying to install Adélie","id":11,"section":"unixlike","tags":null,"title":"Adelie Linux - LiveCD Installation","uri":"https://tiagojsilva.github.io/en/unixlike/musl/2021-09-13_adelie_livecd/"},{"content":"Client and Server Certificates Now that we have our IntermediateCA properly configured, we can start using it to issue certificates.\nNotes:\n You should use no less than half the bits used on the CA for keys The server\u0026rsquo;s CN should be its FQDN A server certificate needs to have the same FQDN repeated on the SAN information The client certificate\u0026rsquo;s CN can be anything, it\u0026rsquo;s not important.

To convince enterprise users to pay up and contribute to the project with monies, they decided that binaries compiled and distributed for installation as an ISO image would only be available to the public in unstable versions, meaning, nightly builds. The last pre-compiled stable version available is 1.1-8, and the most recent version may be in several states of stability, depending on where it is along the release process at that precise moment.\nThis has become more and more usual, most notably (and polemically) when CentOS went from being downstream from RHEL (stable) to upstream, having become the testing version of RHEL\u0026rsquo;s next point-upgrade.\nWant freebies?
