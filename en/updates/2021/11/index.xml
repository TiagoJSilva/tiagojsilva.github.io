        <description>I was just trying to downlood the ESXi evaluation&amp;hellip;
Unless this goes away tomorrow, it looks like my Type1 hypervisor journey will start with XCP-ng&amp;hellip;
You only get one chance to make a good impression.</description>

        <description>I dun it!
The button to copy the contents of the code boxes now appears both in those that have syntax (highlight, chroma) as in those that don&amp;rsquo;t have:
1  cowsay &amp;#34;monkeys, I tell you!&amp;#34;   # output______________________&amp;lt; monkeys, I tell you! &amp;gt;----------------------\ ^__^\ (oo)\_______(__)\ )\/\||----w ||| ||How have I dun it? Dunno&amp;hellip;
Hence the title: one thousand monkeys banging on one thousand typewriters could write &amp;ldquo;The C Programming Language&amp;rdquo; if they had until the heat death of the Universe to do it.</description>

        <title>TinyCore Linux - Initial steps</title>

        <description>For this system, which will eventually be a server called verynice, I made a VM with 256MB of RAM and 640MB of disk.
[TinyCore]1 is a very special Linux installation, destined for systems with very few resources. I&amp;rsquo;ll use the Deluxe version, CorePlus, with leather seats, GUI and possibility of disk installation, but there are leaner flavors of CoreLinux that will cheerfully boot from a 128MB flashdrive and load themselves to a RAMdrive at startup.</description>

        <description>The first time I tried to set up a Copy button for code boxes, I left an issue on Zdoc&amp;rsquo;s GitHub.
Some days ago, another Zdoc user published the solution that worked for him, and stimulated by that, I tried again.
Unfortunately, I must have manipulated my theme&amp;rsquo;s DOM code too much (tracking upstream is going to be impossible until I nuke it and pave it on the next Zdoc release) to be able to use his code, but I tried fiddling a little more with the code I had tried to use previously, which was based on this proposal by Tom Spencer.</description>
