        <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing about some things behind the curtains:
Theme changes I wanted to use a Hugo theme for documentation (structured documents), if possible with an associated blog for less structured content.
My wishlist was (in no particular order):
 Light / dark theme Multilanguage (i18n) Several independent sections Ability to include in the code boxes not only line numbers but also prompts outside of the text, so that they were ignored when copying the contents of the box Have command output boxes with distinct formatting  I only found this theme, Zdoc, that had most of it (Docz seems to be shaping up as an alternative), but it still lacks a lot:</description>

        <description>Linux Dotfiles I&amp;rsquo;ve been gathering settings that make my life easier by solving little nagging problems and papercuts.
Publishing those files here allows me to download them wherever I create a new user account.
The URL for downloading will be https://tiagojsilva.github.io/unix/dotfiles/file
There&amp;rsquo;s a TAR archive of all the files, which you can install right in your home folder (~) with:
1  wget -O- https://tiagojsilva.github.io/unix/dotfiles/dotfiles.tar | tar -xvf- -C ~   .</description>

        <description>Sit down and take a load off.
I have been fortunate to make professions of my passions; as a young&amp;rsquo;un, I had to choose one of them (Sound for Picture), but the swings and roundabouts of life led me to embrace another one, which is IT. By the end of it I ended up back where I had started, but I don&amp;rsquo;t consider it wasted time; I had wonderful teachers and colleagues, and learned a lot of stuff that I had always wanted to know.</description>
