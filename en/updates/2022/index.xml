        <description>Wanted, Dead or Alive: CLI Editor This article was inspired by the page Wanted: Console Text Editor for Windows, which is very thorough and I strongly recommend that you read it (while you&amp;rsquo;re at it, put a star in the Github profile of the author, Antoni Sawicki); however, I discovered so many things in the meantime that I decided maybe I can give my two cents about this.

I tried to get some kind of plugin for Notepad++ or VSCode that would help me, but in the end they all had problems; namely, since my targets and my substitutions have many special characters, I wanted to avoid tools that used regular expressions.</description>

        <description>How we got here The Centos distribution has always been a strange beast: how could it be that the main exclusively paid Linux distribution (Red Hat Enterprise Linux, or RHEL) had a totally free clone?
Therefore, and for reasons I will elaborate below, it did not surprise me that the conditions of use for CentOS have changed, although the method, the time and the way everything was communicated will be a case-study on how-not-to-do&amp;hellip;</description>
