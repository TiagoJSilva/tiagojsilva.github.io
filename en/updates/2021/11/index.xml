        <description>The first time I tried to set up a Copy button for code boxes, I left an issue on Zdoc&amp;rsquo;s GitHub.
Some days ago, another Zdoc user published the solution that worked for him, and stimulated by that, I tried again.
Unfortunately, I must have manipulated my theme&amp;rsquo;s DOM code too much (tracking upstream is going to be impossible until I nuke it and pave it on the next Zdoc release) to be able to use his code, but I tried fiddling a little more with the code I had tried to use previously, which was based on this proposal by Tom Spencer.</description>
