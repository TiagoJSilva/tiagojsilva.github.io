        <description>OpenSSL PKI (part 2) - IntermediateCA Creating an IntermediateCA Once again, the intermediateCA(s) must be hosted in a separate system (server) from that which hosts the RootCA, and the RootCA&amp;rsquo;s system (root) should be airgapped and offline. In the online system I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a bad idea to keep the secondary CAs under /root/ca, which allows the placing the RootCA&amp;rsquo;s certificate on the same path (/root/ca/certs/ca.cert.pem). However, this is the only information from the RootCA that needs to be brought to the online world where the secondary CAs reside; it is even debatable if it is worth bringing the RootCA&amp;rsquo;s CRL in PEM format and putting it in /root/ca/crl/ca.</description>

        <description>Like many other Free and Open Source Software projects, Vyos decided that it was going to continue to be free as in freedom but would stop being for free. To convince enterprise users to pay up and contribute to the project with monies, they decided that binaries compiled and distributed for installation as an ISO image would only be available to the public in unstable versions, meaning, nightly builds. The last pre-compiled stable version available is 1.</description>
