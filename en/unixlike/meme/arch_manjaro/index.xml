        <description>Obarun and S6 The suite S6 - Skarnet.org&amp;rsquo;s Small &amp;amp; Secure Supervision Software Suite includes an init, one of several projects that rebelled against SystemD by trying to prove there were better and/or simpler ways to do the same thing. For whom?
Despite the official implementation of S6 began to be on Alpine Linux, for some reason the author now collaborates with Ad√©lie Linux, which I&amp;rsquo;ve already tried.
However, the most mature implementation of S6-init seems to be on Obarun, an Arch-based distro and, as far as I know, without any input from the author of S6, despite all of them being French.</description>
